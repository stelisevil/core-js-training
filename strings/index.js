/*
  String basics

  In this file you will find functions used to assert your understanding of the
  basics around strings

  Each function has a corrisponsing test in the ./test.js file for you to read
  Don't worry too much about the test suite if it doesn't make sense, that comes
  in time

  Above each function I have written a small description about what I want that
  function to do
